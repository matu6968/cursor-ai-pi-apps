# cursor-ai-pi-apps
Dependencies needed to build Cursor .deb package for use in Pi Apps

## Build instrctions: 
There is both a GitHub workflow and a manual build script that runs on ARM64 Debian based distros.

- For the workflow: it does automatically build the package and publishes to github releases, but currently untested or broken.
- For the manual build script: download the script from the repo and run it. (before that first enable execute permissions on the file)
